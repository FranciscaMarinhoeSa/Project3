
The objetive of the run_analysis R script is to perform 5 actions to tidy the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

Necessarily, there has to be a first step, which prepares the dataset to be worked on, let's call it step 0.

That being said, please find below a summary of what is produced by each step of the script:

0. Dataset prep
- downloads the file
- reads for the txt files all sets to be merged on the next step. 

	. activity_labels.txt
	. features.txt

	subjects
	. subject_test.txt
	. subject_train.txt

	test sets
	. x_test.txt
	. y_test.txt

	train sets
	. x_train.txt
	. y_train

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- uses the rbind function to bind all test and train rowns from x, y and subject datasets
- uses the cbind function to bind all columns from x, y and subject (now test and train datasets)

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- from the inicial database, selects to a new variable called database_MeanAndStd the subject and activityID columns and all columns that contain the words "mean" and "std"

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- renames the activityID column with the proper names from the activity_labels dataset.


4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- using the function gsub, replaces all the column labels abreviations with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- from the database_MeanAndStd, creates a new dataset called new_database with gives us the average of each variable, grouped by subject and activity.

The final dataset produced by the script has 180 observations and 80 variables.
